<h2>AN OPEN LETTER</h2>

<p class="right">The Whiz Bang Farm,<br />
Rural Route No. 2, Robbinsdale, Minn.</p>

<p class="noindent">To Our Readers:</p>

<p>With this issue, Captain Billy’s Whiz Bang discards
swaddling clothes and starts bounding on
its second year of existence. In this number,
which we have termed “Our Annual,” the writer
has taken the liberty to review many of the stories
and poems from the 12 previous issues. It is
obvious that a new publication must start with
no circulation. If it strikes a popular appeal in
the heart-chord of human existence it succeeds;
otherwise, it sinks into journalistic oblivion.</p>

<p>Thanks to a legion of loyal readers and volunteer
scribes, The Whiz Bang has weathered the
colicky and diarrhoetic stage of life. Our eye-teeth
have been cut and the worst is over. This
little family journal of uplift has no one to thank
but its readers. It is your magazine and it is you
who send in the snappy articles to fill its pages
each month. Again we extend our heartiest
thanks.</p>

<p>We are now spread from the mackerel munching
macaroons of Manhattan’s bright isle to the
squawking squabs of sunny California; from the
wily, wicked pole-cats of Northern Minnesota to
the perk and prim creoles of feverish Orleans.</p>

<p>On this month, the month of our birth, the
editor feels as happy as a kid sucking a lollypop
and smearing its chin with an ice cream cone. All
we lack to complete the illusion is about three
fingers in a wash-tub. Adios until November
rolls ’round.</p>

<h2><i>Skipping with the Skipper</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Just one short year ago, under the above caption:
“Skipping With the Skipper,” Captain Billy’s
Whiz Bang exploded for the first time. It was the
publisher’s idea at that time to compile a snappy joke-book
for former soldiers, sailors and marines living in
the immediate vicinity of the village of Robbinsdale.
The demand greatly exceeded the initial press run, and
we’ve been running ever since.</p>

<p>For the benefit of new readers, the opening explanation
for our existence on this mundane sphere is
herewith re-published. It explains itself, I believe:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="bold">Whiz-z Bang!!! We’re off and in our trail
follows a mighty explosion of pedigreed bull.
“Make It Snappy” is our motto. Snap!
Pep! Ginger! Even more. The first issue of
CAPTAIN BILLY’S WHIZ BANG is off the
press and with its advent the editor and contributors
hope to have added something really
worth while to brighten the atmosphere of human
existence. Captain Billy’s only and original
WHIZ BANG will explode in every issue.
No “duds” allowed in our monthly Literary
Indigestion. Today we are the Cherry Sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of journalism with the fond hopes for “Big
Time” sometime.</p>

<p class="bold">As the old saying goes, “Laugh and the
world laughs with you, near beer and you
drink alone.” If we dance we must pay the
jazz band; no matter what we get we must
“put up or shut up.” Doctors of Dope and
Doctors of Divinity must have the price of our
life and love and the undertaker smiles with a
self-satisfied grin as our mortal flesh and
bones are delivered to the charnel house.</p>

<p class="bold">Therefore the motto of the WHIZ BANG
will be: Be happy while you live; live a full
life and while you are living, live on the square
so you may be able to follow that quaint western
philosophy and look every man in the face
and tell him to go to Hell.</p>

<p class="bold">Please do not get the impression from the
title page that the WHIZ BANG is to be a
military publication only. There will be 100
laughs for the service man and 97¼ laughs for
the civilian. We will give the soldier, sailor
and marine the benefit of two and three-quarters
per cent because we believe he is fairly
entitled to it. (Brewers please note.)</p>

<p class="bold">THE WHIZ BANG is only in its infancy,
so look for the November issue. Then we will
burst out and explode into a full-grown bull.
We will be fatter, lovelier, snappier and juicier
and&mdash;oh, girls, we just hate to tell you. Watch
for Mr. November and see if we don’t make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Bill Bryan’s Commoner drier than an Algerian
caravan in the Sahara desert, 20 miles from
the oasic grog shop and the Cliquot Special
two weeks overdue. The bull is only half
grown and he surely will be some lively animal
next month when we sling him over to our
readers.</p>

<p class="bold">Those of us who have lived through the
past five years have the satisfaction of knowing
that we have seen the mightiest and most
stirring five years in history, and we are
watching from day to day the unfolding and
ending of the colossal drama. Never has there
been such a crashing of empires, such a falling
of thrones, such righting of wrongs and
deliverance of the oppressed, such vivid demonstration
of the wickedness, the folly and the
weakness, the nobility, the wisdom and the
courage of which human nature is capable.</p>

<p class="bold">As a grand finale, an alleviation from the
terrific strain, Billy’s WHIZ BANG will come
as a relieving Balsam&mdash;an ointment on the
checkered skein of life. Please remember that
the oldest truths are the freshest. They are
rich with the blood of humanity. As the
apple tree in your yard may be a sprout from
the apple tree in the Garden of Eden, so the
idea that just came to you may be the same
that struck King Solomon. Thoughts are deciduous,
as trees, and appear green and fresh
to each generation, and like desert soil, we are
unfurrowed and unfettered. THE EDITOR.</p>

<h2><i>The Crap Shooting Major</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">By SKIPPER BILL.</p>

<p class="dropcap">This is a story of a major in the Motor Mechanics
brigade, Signal Corps, U. S. Army,&mdash;A. C. Rebadow,
by name. He hails from the city of Buffalo,
N. Y., where he was employed in an automobile manufacturing
plant and received his commission because
of the supposition that he was a motor sharp.</p>

<p>“Soldiering” and gambling go hand in hand. The
greatest indoor sport of the military man is to riffle
the “pasteboards,” while his outdoor pastime consists
of blowing on a pair of galloping dominoes as he prays
for a “natural” to rear itself heavenward. Rebadow
is neither soldier nor gambler but a dyed-in-the-wool
squawker.</p>

<p>The “major’s” system was simple. If he lost he
merely issued checks on his bank at Tonawanda, N. Y.,
and then “Stopped Payment,” on them. So simple, in
fact, that his racial instinct led him promptly to the
telegraph office to void the payment.</p>

<p>The Major relied upon military discipline to save
him from his outraged victims. He believed that none
would have nerve enough to make complaint against
his ungentlemanly and indecent behavior, but at least
on one occasion he reckoned without his host. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was at Camp Hancock, Georgia, where Rebadow lost
$400 during several days’ indulgence at craps. The
victim, however, took the matter up with the superior
officers.</p>

<p>Rebadow was traced to an air post far behind the
whiz bangs’ zone where he possibly imagined himself
safe from his debtors as well as from the Jerries. This
is a letter which compelled payment. It was written
by one superior officer to another, the commandant at
the air post where Rebadow was then situated:</p>

<p>“1. It is requested that the Commanding Officer
of A. A. A. P. No. 1 take this matter up personally with
Major Rebadow, as the following are the facts in the
case, as can be supported by the record of the Motor
Mechanics Brigade, which records I have personally
inspected. Several months ago an exhaustive investigation
of the merits of this case was made and it was
shown that Major Rebadow was entirely in the wrong
in this matter and was dropped on account of an indorsement
he signed in which he stated he would make
good the amount of these checks, approximately $400.</p>

<p>“2. The unprincipled manner in which Major
Rebadow now treats this matter is considered so reprehensible
that effort is being made to secure the forwarding
of the personal file of Major Rebadow and he
may be informed that unless this account has been
settled by the time those records are received that this
office will make all efforts to have Major Rebadow
brought to trial as a result of his derelictions.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, Major Rebadow cowered before
the eye of his superior officer and forthwith repaid
the broken pledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>I look back on my days in the ranks, where a man
was a man, true blue and shorn of falsity, insolence,
domineering and double-crossing ways. They were the
days when we got paid together, painted the town together,
and went broke together, where every man
“shot square” with his “buddie.”</p>

<p>As for this crap-shooting major, he is in civies
again and military discipline will afford him no protection
for such breeches.</p>

<h3>’Twas Ever Thus</h3>

<p>Every time we see an article offered at an uncommonly
low price&mdash;whether it be shoes, prunes, fountain
pens, wood blocks, or a personal service of some kind&mdash;we
are reminded of Chief Big Smoke.</p>

<p>The owner of this picturesque name was a copper-colored
native employed as a missionary to his fellow
smokes out in Oklahoma. A tourist once asked him
what he did for a living.</p>

<p>“Umph!” said Big Smoke, “me preachum.”</p>

<p>“That so? What do you get for preaching?”</p>

<p>“Me get ten dollars a year.”</p>

<p>“Well,” commented the white man, “that’s
d&mdash;&mdash;n poor pay.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” replied Big Smoke, “me d&mdash;&mdash;n poor
preacher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>The Eternal Feminine</h3>

<p>Women want marriage and a home. They should.
And there are more women than men. Even before
the war there was, in Europe and America, an extra
sixth woman for every five men, and the sixth woman
brings competition. She bulls the market, and makes
feminine sex solidarity impossible. And, of course,
added to that is the woman who requires three or four
men to make her happy, one to marry and support her,
and one to take her to the theatre and to luncheon at
Delmonico’s, and generally fetch and carry for her,
and one to remember her as she was at nineteen and
remain a bachelor and have a selfish, delightful life,
while blaming her.&mdash;Mary Roberts Rinehart.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>Move Over</h3>

<p>Bridget failed to get up one morning to cook
breakfast for the Smith family. Instead she yelled
downstairs that she was “pretty sick.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith promptly summoned his family doctor
who gave the “sick” servant a thorough examination.
The doctor was unable to find anything wrong with
Bridget.</p>

<p>“My good woman,” he said, “you’re not sick at
all.”</p>

<p>“I know I’m not,” Bridget replied, “but the
Smiths owe me $20 and I’m going to stay in bed until
they pay me.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s the case, move over; they owe me
$50.”</p>

<h2><i>Golightly Highballs</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL.</p>

<h3>Mexico</h3>

<p class="dropcap">V. C. in Vera Cruz stands for Venereal City. “El
Dictamen” is the leading newspaper. It has
only four pages, yet whole columns are filled
with advertised cures for scrofula, syphilis, locomotor-ataxia
and all the rotten ills that licentious Latin-America
is heir to. The space we give to weather reports
on the front page, or to special news with extra
headlines, is given up here to nauseating advertisements.
The first thing one sees as he enters the plaza
are billboards, walls and buildings with sure-cure advertisements.</p>

<p>L. A. in Latin America stands for “licentious animals.”
In Vera Cruz the principal male pastime is to
talk about girls and not of God. From 4 P. M. to
2 A. M. men sit in the plaza portales drinking, smoking
and talking about the women who pass by. The leading
subject of “town talk” is girls, the one they went
to the movie with last, the other one the night before,
and the one they hope to get tonight.</p>

<p>The people make themselves a sewer for immoral
filth, court the devil Lust that eats and burns up their
blood; are spendthrifts of body and soul; waste their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
inheritance to purchase dirty, loathed disease; pawn
their bodies to a dry-rot evil; make themselves patients
for Lust’s rendezvous, a hospital, where their bill of
fare is pills, not beef, and the doctor’s bill is longer
than the moral law they have violated. What I have
written here about Vera Cruz morals applies to the rest
of Mexico where conditions are the same or worse.</p>

<p>The Ten Commandments are little in evidence in
the country and free love prevails with the fruit of seventy-five
per cent of illegitimate births. A respectable
bachelor is not qualified to enter society until several
children call him “papa.” Few men are without a
separate establishment for affinities.</p>

<h3>Honolulu</h3>

<p>The Hawaiians are out and out in their dancing.
They do not gloss it over and wear no hypocritical fig-leaves.
They do not throw masks or mantles over their
viciousness, under the guise of religious charity balls
and philanthropic society parties. The hula is a hip
dance, but the Hawaiians are not “hip”&mdash;ocritical in
doing it. The dance is not sad or hippish but one of
joy.</p>

<p>I have seen many dances&mdash;the Apache in Paris,
du ventre in Cairo, the can-can in Buenos Aires, and
with money here in Honolulu one can arrange with a
chauffeur or at a hula house to see a hula combining
all these vile and violent exhibitions. It is a composite
of the compost of all dirty dances, most delightfully depraved,
innocent of decency and shame, the dancers
being quite careless about the exposure of their legs,
arms and charms. What captivating indelicacy, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
disturbing to the looker-on. But this it not the native
hula. There is sufficient of the sun and volcano without
it. The whites have taken away the native naivete
and added their own nastiness. As a physiological
study the dance is informing. In antiquity these
antics were a religious service, combining poetry, pantomime
and passion. The old edition of the heathen
hula dance has been expurgated, but Christian foot-notes
suggest more.</p>

<p>At one hula house I witnessed an unscheduled
fight between several sailors who had quarreled over
the charms of a hula girl with the result of broken
heads, hearts and furniture. The native proprietor
welcomed us with characteristic Hawaiian hospitality&mdash;we
could eat, drink and stay as long as we pleased&mdash;all
night in fact, with his hula girls for company. I
thanked him for his ancient, beautiful and unbounded
generosity but told him I was married and a minister,
although he seemed unable to understand why that
should make any difference with me, since it made
little to some of the local clergy and laity.</p>

<p>One day at high noon, not night, I saw several
native women bathing at Waikiki beach. All they had
on was a holoku night-gown that was as good as nothing
when wet. Three white, male strangers sauntered up
from the nearby hotel, waded in, threw their arms
around the girls and were guilty of “divers” familiarities.
The girls didn’t object to the conduct of the
boys. I couldn’t help seeing or thinking whether the
fishes swam away or stayed and blushed all colors.
Here was a “freedom of the seas” I refer to the naval
board for diplomatic discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>God’s righteousness is like the great mountains. I
often thought, as I marvelled at the islands’ scenery,
that there are sermons in stones, but men do not listen;
summits preach high ideals and purity, but people are
deaf; and nature’s green only looks down on the mud
and mire of lucre, lies, lust and laziness.</p>

<h3>Havana</h3>

<p>Havana is a fool’s Paradise&mdash;a lunatic limbo for
people with loud clothes, lots of money, loose morals
and light heads. It is the place where bad folks go to
have a good time. The more disreputable a city is, the
more popular it is to high society.</p>

<p>I have visited Havana many times and found the
H in its name stood for Hell, not Heaven. On a recent
sojourn I asked a traveling companion what the state
of religion was and if Havana’s morals were improved.
“Oh, yes, there has been a great reformation.” He
had scarcely made this gratifying statement when a
young man came up to me and showed some vile postcards
and postals which he offered for sale. This did
not happen in a side street at night, but in Central
Park at noon.</p>

<p>Havana has reformed! The city has no “segregation,”
but you may walk for miles along streets to the
waterfront and find every other house with a seductive
senorita at the door or window with extended hand or
winsome voice urging you in broken Spanish or
English to forsake the counsel of your mother’s Bible.
Regular saloons and concert halls had scores of the
women of the town at the tables sitting with motley
men, while glasses clinked and phonographs scratched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
their screechy music. This was all bad enough but the
lowest hell was reached when I saw a woman standing
in the doorway offering to sell a girl of about 14 who
stood by her side. At the end of certain streets the
police were on watch to keep the women off the sidewalks,
and so maintain an appearance of decency and
order. Other places were unwatched and free.</p>

<p>Havana has reformed! The sporting women of the
town advertise in several of the local magazines, where
you find their photos, house address and some such
paragraph in Spanish or in English for the benefit of
the American tourist: “Tourist! Do you wish a good
house in Havana, with plenty of women, pretty and
elegant? Go to &mdash;&mdash; street, No. &mdash;&mdash;, ask for Helena.
Go today.” Here’s another: “Artistic Academy. If
you want a place for pleasure and a good time, go to
&mdash;&mdash;, plenty of nice girls.” Another want ad
reads: “Ladies from all nations,” and still another,
“Violeta has moved to &mdash;&mdash; street, and with her
Parisian arts welcomes the Havana public.”</p>

<p>Poor pleasure-seekers, whose law is fashion and
folly their pursuit! Bubbles on the wave of pleasure,
a tracery on the sand which Time’s tide will soon erase.
Every year the siren voice of Havana calls, “Come in
your private yacht on the Gulf Stream of gold; come
with full purse and empty head and heart; come, you
‘best’ society, that you may be seen at your worst;
come, all ye who would desert the temple of your mind
and soul for this Circe’s palace of fleshy pleasures!”</p>

<h3>Central America</h3>

<p>Hamlet found something “rotten in the state of
Denmark,” but it was sweet compared with what I discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in Central America&mdash;the land of eruption and
corruption, of dirt, disease, destitution, darkness, dilapidation,
despots, delay, debt, deviltry and degeneracy,
where a conservative estimate makes 90 per cent of the
women immoral, 95 per cent of the men thieves, and
100 per cent of the population liars.</p>

<p>While strolling about the sultry seaport of Amapala,
Spanish Honduras, and thinking of Morazan, the
great Honduran liberator, two deceitful dames sought
to enslave me. I was a stranger and they tried to take
me in&mdash;their home nearby. Fortunately a policeman
came up and warned me in broken English that these
girls were “always&mdash;very&mdash;bad&mdash;to&mdash;everybody.”
Each one took my arm and I thought it was time to
take to my legs and get away. Anticipating my flight,
one of them sprang upon me, wrapped her nether limbs
about my waist and her arms around my neck. Thus
in broad daylight in the heart of the town and in full
view of the passerby I was attacked and assaulted.
What a shipwreck of character might have happened
had I landed at night! I hurried back to the ship and
sought the seclusion my cabin afforded. The captain
congratulated me on my narrow escape and informed
me that on nearly every trip to this port native women
of the town attempt to smuggle themselves at night
on board to exchange their morals for the sailors’
money.</p>

<h3>Panama</h3>

<p>The last time I visited the Panama Canal it was
closed, but the town was wide open. Former streets
called straight were crooked and some rescued territory
had relapsed. Just off the main street the scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
woman and the red light flourished and flaunted. Posing
as bar-girls these women came out boldly with the
bar-sinister of their profession, came with forbidden
fruit from the “Cocoa Grove,” and exposed it for sale
on West Sixteenth street, contaminating the young.
The groves may have been God’s first temples, but
not this Panama “Cocoa” one. Here Satan conducts
services every day of the year and passion-fruit is
offered all who walk its thoroughfares. One finds all
colors, classes and conditions of carnality. The U. S.
soldiers are the police because the Panamanian police
hate our boys sober or drunk, and when our boys had
a fight the Panamanians beat them up. There are dens
of high and low degree, full of filth, profanity, drunkenness,
disease and debauchery, I know, for I saw, and
I saw because I was there for local color and it was
black enough.</p>

<p>Panama is famous for its canal, the wedlock of the
oceans, but the city Panama is infamous, knows little
of the family word “wedlock” and its red light “Cocoa
Light” would make the fabled Daphne Grove wither
up with envy. From the first to the fifteenth of each
month the U. S. soldiers receive their pay and spend a
large amount of it here in wine, women and song. In
this pandemonium of profligacy, one may see, at any
hour of the day or night, a brave soldier boy, intoxicated
with love or liquor, sitting in a doorway with a
half-dressed, bare-legged girl in his lap. These girls
are o. k.’d by an M. D. twice a week and pronounced
all right. Our soldiers cannot leave camp and visit
them without a card certificate of good character. After
they have made a night of it the boys repair to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
“House of Lords” in the district and receive a bath
and inoculation of anti-venereal dope. If they fail to
take this treatment and are contaminated, they suffer
more ways than one, being compelled to pay a fine.
This is all too bad. Pleasures pure and simple should
be given them at camp or in barracks. As it is, many
of them are “shot to hell” before they ever go to war.
If they have any extra money, strength or inclination,
they may hit the opium-pipe, buy a get-rich-quick lottery
ticket, or on Sunday attend a bullfight. A modern
St. Anthony would find it difficult to withstand the
temptations of this zone. More than one Pan-American
religious conference is needed to make the moral
atmosphere as pure as the city streets are clean. It is
a bigger job to kill the devil than to exterminate the
yellow-fever mosquito.</p>

<h3>Friendship and Love</h3>

<p>What causes the majority of women to be so little
touched by friendship is that it is insipid when they
have once tasted of love.</p>

<h3>She Quit the Union</h3>

<p>A party went to the opera and occupied a box.
One of the men saw a raveling on the shoulder of one
of the ladies. He picked it, and it kept on coming. He
pulled and pulled till he had a tremendous mass, which
he threw behind the door. Some days after the men
met and talked it over. One of them said: “My wife
had a good time, but she cannot figure out how she lost
her union suit.”</p>

<h2><i>Highty-tighty Aphrodite</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">At present, partly owing to what is very modestly
called “barefoot” dancing, a severe season of
clothelessness prevails; and the aforementioned
exercises afford the public quite a fair idea of
“the most admirable spectacle in nature”&mdash;that is to
say, bowlegs, knock-knees, thick ankles, spray feet,
shoulders scraggy or pudgy, knees bony or lumpy, and
weirdly shaped legs.</p>

<p>The modernist poets also have been seized by the
mania for nudity&mdash;but let us hope that with them it is
rather theory than practice; for the average literator
is not usually “a dream of form in days of thought.”
One mocking rhymester thus makes game of such poetic
aspirations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container sans">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All the poets have been stripping,</div>
<div class="verse">Quaintly into moonbeams slipping,</div>
<div class="verse">Running out like wild Bacchantes,</div>
<div class="verse">Minus lingerie and panties.</div>
<div class="verse">Never knew of such a frantic</div>
<div class="verse">Belvederean, corybantic,</div>
<div class="verse">Highty-tighty Aphrodite,</div>
<div class="verse">Stepping out without a nightie.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of these modernist bards puts her own fancies
into the brain of an old-time lady, stiff in pink and
silver brocade, as she walks in a prim garden awaiting
the coming of her suitor. She would like to leave “all
that pink and silver crumpled on the ground”; for,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container sans">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Underneath my stiffened gown</div>
<div class="verse">Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus divested of raiment, “I would be the pink
and silver as I ran along the paths,” and her lover,
seeing her, would pursue “till he caught me in the
shade.” A writer of free verse is more candid; it is
herself she would disrobe. “Since the earliest days I
have dressed myself in fanciful clothes,” she says, trying
to express herself in this manner; but now she is
weary of putting “romance and fantasy into my raiment.”
She realizes that “my clothes are not me,
myself”; hence the stern resolve:</p>

<div class="poetry-container sans">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I think I shall go naked into the streets,</div>
<div class="verse">And wander unclothed into people’s parlors.</div>
<div class="verse">The incredulous eyes of the bewildered world</div>
<div class="verse">Might give me back my true image ...</div>
<div class="verse">Maybe in the glances of others</div>
<div class="verse">I would find out what I really am.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Doubtless she would; but perhaps not exactly as
she means it. Wandering “unclothed into people’s
parlors,” if police vigilance could be eluded, might be
a way of seeing ourselves as others see us, since the
owners of the parlors would probably be startled into
candid comment, instead of, as usual, waiting until the
unclad back of the visitant was turned. It would be a
happy arrangement if only the truly symmetrical would
indulge in semi-nudity. Such exhibitions are a form
of female vanity; but if the average woman will but
realize it, she owes any admiration she may excite to
the saving graces of clothes. If she is wise she will
foster the illusion. As a poet of another era expressed
it, “Oh, the little less, and what worlds away!”</p>

<h2><i>In the Grip of a Dream</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The dreamer is with us. From early youth there
comes anon a time when the sense of great loneliness
and mysticism leads one out to the wilderness
of the Dream God. Conceptions of dreams and of
love are two difficult tasks, but Robert W. Chambers
seems to have made greater headway than other
authors. In his book, “The Danger Mark,” he thus
describes the feelings that passed over poor, troubled
Geraldine:</p>

<p>“We’re pretty young yet, Geraldine.... I
never saw a girl I cared for as I might have cared for
you. It’s true, no matter what I have done, or may
do.... But you’re quite right, a man of that
sort isn’t to be considered,” he laughed and pulled on
one glove, “only&mdash;I knew as soon as I saw you that it
was to be you or&mdash;everybody. First, it was anybody;
then it was you&mdash;now it’s everybody. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she managed to say. The dizzy waves
swayed her; she rested her cheeks between both hands
and, leaning there heavily, closed her eyes to fight
against it. She had been seated on the side of a
lounge; and now, feeling blindly behind her, she moved
the cushions aside, turned and dropped among them,
burying her blazing face. Over her the scorching
vertigo swept, subsided, rose, and swept again. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the horror of it!&mdash;the shame, the agonized surprise.
What was this dreadful thing that, for the second time,
she had unwittingly done? And this time it was so
much more terrible. How could such an accident have
happened to her? How could she face her own soul in
the disgrace of it?</p>

<p>Fear, loathing, frightened incredulity that this
could really be herself, stiffened her body, and clinched
her hands under her parted lips. On them her hot
breath fell irregularly.</p>

<p>Rigid, motionless, she lay, breathing faster and
more feverishly. Tears came after a long while, and
with them relaxation and lassitude. She felt that the
dreadful thing which had seized and held her was letting
go its hold, was freeing her body and mind; and
as it slowly released her and passed on its terrible
silent way, she awoke and sat up with a frightened
cry, to find herself lying on her own bed in utter darkness.</p>

<p>Yes, Worried Wifie, they do. One of the favorite

African golf. Two galloping dominoes are used in
place of a small ball. Instead of the greens, the latrine
floor is usually garnished with greenbacks and set off
in silver. “Big Dick” and “Little Joe” act as caddies
and there is more cussing at a “flock of box cars” than
a minister foozling a putt. I indulged in a friendly
game of dancing dominoes last night with my old
buddy, Mr. “Eighter from Decatur.” “Jimmy Hicks”

<h2><i>Seeing Los Angeles</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">By JACK ANDREWS</p>

<p class="dropcap">Rubbernecking via the bally-ho wagons has
received a terrible set-back in the beautiful city
of the Angels. No more will the gossip-hungry
tourists be fed on the scandal of the movie colony from
a megaphone in the hands of a husky-voiced “spieler.”
An edict has gone forth forbidding these caterers to
wet the appetites of the unlearned and seeking visitors
of Los Angeles to exploit the “affairs” of the celebrities
in press agent fashion.</p>

<p>Los Angeles officials contend that it is no nice way
to entertain their guests where skeletons are said to
exist in every closet in Hollywood.</p>

<p>There is no question but what the moving picture
business has a lot of deserving people in it, and some
of the most admirable characters to be found are of the
cinema crowd, but we have recently had a few stellar
lights before the international eye in roles that were
disgusting.</p>

<p>Here are some of the utterances the city fathers
say should be dispensed with:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="bold">“To your right, folks, is the home of
Charlie, now used exclusively by Mildred and
her mother, who is also her business manager.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p class="bold">“On your left is the home of Lottie, sister
of Mary, who has a standing offer to fight any
woman in the business.”</p>

<p class="bold">“Jack, who is also one of the family, was
living in the bungalow on yonder hill before
his wife came back from New York. He left

<p>Is the theater becoming immoral? The majority
of critics claim it is. The WHIZ BANG disagrees on
this point. We claim the motion picture development
has stopped the sporadic growth of suggestive plays on
the legitimate stage.</p>

<p>The immoral, or at least suggestive plays made
their first appearance in any large number twenty
years ago. Witness “Three Weeks,” “Sappho,” “Du
Barry,” and others, and still today you will find these
plays in oblivion. Together with them, the women who
starred in such plays are almost unheard of today.
Most prominent among these is Olga Nethersole.</p>

<p>She was an English governess in the ’80’s and
startled London with her portrayals of “The Transgressor,”
“Magda” and other productions of like character.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago Miss Nethersole shocked two
continents with her “Sappho Kiss.” She always maintained
that playing the parts of these easy women
would “make” her. Witness her interview of more
than five years ago, in which she is quoted as having
said:</p>

<p>“People have not understood that I chose to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
prostitutes because I have felt it my work to aid the
world by showing the suffering in it. If I felt that I
had not been chosen for this task I should never have
given my life to it.</p>

<p>“Do you know the story of Alexander Dumas, the
younger? He was an illegitimate son, whose father
refused to wed his mother. Thereupon the son gave
up his life to the cause of woman and wrote his plays
with the suffering of woman uppermost. ‘Camille’ will
live forever.</p>

<p>“I have felt that if I could show the suffering and
the misery that illicit passion causes I could do something
for the world, could point a way toward removing
the evil.”</p>

<p>And today, Olga Nethersole’s prediction has fallen
flat. Her name, or the names of her mimics, no longer
are blazoned on the electric signs of Broadway. Olga
Nethersole, and the principle for which she stood, are
in oblivion.</p>

<p>This is the era of keepers, too. Our collective national
appetite has been entrusted to the keeping of
four Bills. I refer to Bill Bryan, Billy Sunday, Bill
Anderson of the Antisaloon League and Billy-Be-Damned.
Those of us who once owned thirsts rapidly
are becoming reconciled to the prospect of seeing about
every other man in this country established in the role
of his brother’s keeper&mdash;not his barkeeper, perish the
thought&mdash;but the sort of keeper who keeps his charges
locked up in an iron barred cage and whacks them
across the nose with a steel rod of sumptuary discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
should they manifest a desire once in a while to indulge
in a little personal liberty.</p>

<p>It has become the custom for many police departments
to resort to underhanded methods in obtaining
evidence wherewith to bring guilty persons to trial for
certain offences, the plan adopted being the employment
of what is commonly known as “stool pigeons”&mdash;go-betweens
who act in direct conjunction with the police.
Concerning those who allow themselves to be so
employed there is little to be said other than that they
are not fit for decent society. It is a sneaking way of
securing a living and those who lend themselves to it
ought to be ostracized by citizens who believe in conforming
to the ordinary decencies of life.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Moral reformers are altogether too ambitious. They
want to abolish vice but they cannot do it. Vice is not
crime, although the two things are often confounded.
The word “vice” literally means a fault or error. A
crime is a deliberate violation of the law of God or man.</p>

<p>Why should we be so serious and so violent in our
attitude toward human vice? The root of the evil is in
the weakness or wickedness of human nature. What
is needed is to invigorate humanity with that moral
strength which resists the inroads of vice. There
are periods in the history of every nation when
certain forms of vice are particularly flagrant. This
was so when civilized Greece had lost her pristine manliness.
It was so when pagan Rome was near her fall.
It was so, unhappily, in England in the nineties of the
last century, which saw the popularity of such literary
and artistic decadents as Oscar Wilde and Aubrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Beardsley. Wise reformers will not ever deceive themselves
by thinking that they can eradicate vice. They
will try to lessen vice by moral suasion and by removing
the economic causes which are the promoters of
evil living. To put wretched people into jail is not the
best way to reform them. It is better to make them see
that a life of virtue pays better than a life of vice. This
may be a low utilitarian standard, but it will appeal to
those who are altogether guided by considerations of
profit or loss.</p>

<p>The alimentary canal of the business world needs
a physic. It’s the same in business as with the human
system, when things get clogged. We’ve been gorging
the system of the business world until its tripe needs
scraping. We’ve kept the hopper too full for a healthy
elimination, and we need calomel and rhubarb for a
change. Capital has allowed its cormorant-like propensities
to assume the proportions of a boa constrictor
in trying to swallow not only the calf but the whole
herd. Labor, following closely in the wake of capital
and profiting by its example, has pulled the bridle off
of the horse and started it down the road of reason for
a head-on collision with the captain of industry, who is
stepping on the tail of his big Packard, and both will
be injured. Cornering the earth and setting the price
of all things required for man’s welfare has come home
to roost in demands for wages double and treble what
they used to be, and both capital and labor must be
purged of this overload on the liver of righteousness
or the undertaker will have an unusually thriving
business very soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The tendency of present-day writers and authors
of fiction stories to deal in suggestiveness is perhaps
explained in the popularity of the magazines which
cater to these outpourings. Gouverneur Morris is one
of these, and who can say that Mr. Morris is not one of
the foremost writers of the day? In his latest masterpiece,
“The Wild Goose,” which appeared recently in
Hearst’s, he writes, for instance:</p>

<p>One of the shoulder-straps of her night-gown had
slipped so that Diana’s left breast was almost wholly
bare. At her husband’s next words she hastily pulled
the night-gown back into place, as she might have done
if he had stepped suddenly into view.</p>

<p>“I could crawl to you on my hands and knees,” he
said, “if I could lay my head on your breast just one
little moment.”</p>

<p>“Frank,” she exclaimed, “I am so sorry! But
please, please&mdash;this is no time to discuss what’s been
and gone and happened. Do go back to bed....
Count the sheep going over the hurdle.... Don’t
you know I’d do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;anything&mdash;except
the things I can’t do?...”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then the man spoke
again.</p>

<p>“Do have pity,” he said, “for Christ’s sake!”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Then we have Arthur Somers Roche who quite
often reveals much truth in his fiction. Writing recently
in the Cosmopolitan, Roche, perhaps unconsciously,
reveals a time-worn trick of the woman of
the street in “working” a male victim. He writes:</p>

<p>The difficulty with the Waiters’ Union had resulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in the engaging of girls as waitresses at the
Central. An extremely pretty girl had just served
Mr. Dabney with something. Inspiration had come to
him as he started to tip her.</p>

<p>“Worth just fifty cents, m’dear, if I put it in your
hand. Worth five dollars if I put it in your stocking.
What say?”</p>

<p>The waitress essayed coyness, but failed in her
endeavor. Five dollars was five dollars. She turned
slightly to one side; her skirt was raised; into her
stocking-top Dabney slipped the five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>No invention of modern history has ever been
acclaimed with the enthusiasm that greeted Mr. Dabney’s
strikingly original idea. There was a yell from
Mr. Ladd’s table; as explanation shot about the room,
hilarity reached its highest pitch. Immediately a
dozen girls stood close to tables, while unsteady hands
that held bills fumbled at the tops of stockings.</p>

<h3>Those Kilkenny Kats</h3>

<p>A story is told of an agent who accompanied a
prospective buyer to the vast granite quarries south of
St. Cloud, Minn. While there a cat passed them and
seemed to be in a hurry. The P. B. noticed it, but said
nothing. In a few moments another cat appeared and
ran in the same direction. The P. B. looked at the
agent, but he seemed to be paying no attention to the
cats. When the third cat finally flew by and vanished
in the distance, the P. B. could no longer withhold his
curiosity.</p>

<p>“What in the world is the matter with those
cats?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter with the cats,” answered the
agent, unconcernedly, “but it’s nine miles to dirt.”</p>

<h3>Yes, God Bless ’Em</h3>

<p class="noindent">Skipper Bill:</p>

<p>May you grant me the privilege of expostulating
to the tune of a jazz strain, which is indicative of life,
the melody of the living and the nemesis of the dead,
and dying.</p>

<p>Under the cloak of religion there are too many
one-cylinder brains functioning to the detriment of our
country, creed and constitution, and the space you
allotted to the vituperations of an ecclesiastic ass,
yclept Rev. J. Herbden Walters, was just two pages too
much.</p>

<p>Women have always been enigmas so far as man is
concerned, and it doesn’t require any brand of spiritual
interpretation to convince us mortals that such a
condition is in keeping with Allah’s plan of things.</p>

<p>No man who ever fell for the charms of a woman
can point an accusing finger at her. When she makes
herself “sweet to look upon” she is but fulfilling her
destiny on this earth, and the power of man was created
for the sole purpose of battering down her resistence&mdash;that’s
God’s law; it’s the same in all forms of
life.</p>

<p>No, Bill, his dose is diarrhoetic and we are not
seeking purgatives. His mentality is sadly lacking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his virility could well be questioned. Personally, such
festers on our social cosmos sort o’ rankles me, for I
try to atune myself to the Greater Law.</p>

sentiments, let me enlist the eloquence of Alexander
Smith, whose brain gave birth to these lines:</p>

takes the Bible he will be a preacher, if he takes the
money he will be a business man, and if he takes the
whiskey he will be no good.” Having thus decided on
the plan, he arranged the articles and concealed himself
to await the son and watch results. Presently in
came the boy, saw the money and put it in his pocket,
took up the bottle of whiskey and drank it, put the
Bible under his arm and walked out whistling. “My

<p>The automobile stopped and one of the men got

for killing a calf that belonged to another farmer. This
time he was wary.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
